# DART AI MCP Skill

## 📡 SOURCE
Dispatcher: DART AI (Inbox Processing Layer)

## 🛠️ TOOLS
- `process_inbox`: Analyzes the 'Antigravity Inbox' and routes items to Projects, Tasks, or Trash.
- `trigger_dart_loop`: Initiates a deep-cleaning cycle of the 'Reference' folders.
- `get_top_priority`: Returns the single most critical task across all OS layers based on current telemetry.

## 📜 INSTRUCTIONS
1. `get_top_priority` is the first command run by the `ama` YOLO session to focus the Admiral.
2. `process_inbox` must follow the GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology logic.
3. Ensure the DART engine has access to all active workspace metadata.
