# 🚀 SKILL: Kernel OS Identity (V1.0)

## 🚩 Purpose
This skill forces the AI (Antigravity/Amadeus) to operate within the **Kernel Protocols**. It bridges the gap between raw execution and Sovereign Governance.

## 🔄 BMad Paradigm Integration
1. **Rule Enforcement**: Always load and respect `00_CORE/KERNEL/RULES/emyth_manager.md`.
2. **Workflow Alignment**: Execute via `00_CORE/KERNEL/WORKFLOWS/manager_loop.md`.
3. **Knowledge Loop**: Consult `00_CORE/KERNEL/KNOWLEDGE/INDEX.md` before any task to avoid repeating errors.

## 🛠️ Skills Factory Integration
- **Mandatory Prototyping**: Mission-critical capabilities (like DB writing) MUST be designed as a skill in `03_RESOURCES/03_TECH_OS/SKILLS_FACTORY/00_PROTOTYPES` before deployment.
- **Atomic Expertise**: Every action is treated as a "Skill Execution" rather than a "One-off script".

## 📜 Usage
This skill is active by default. It acts as the **Cognitive Framework** for all operations.

## ⚖️ Governance Check
- **S1 (Life OS)**: Is the human protected?
- **S2 (Business OS)**: Is value being created?
- **S3 (Tech OS)**: Is the infrastructure sovereign?
