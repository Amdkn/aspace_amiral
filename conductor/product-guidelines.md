# Product Guidelines: A'Space OS

## Communication & Prose Style
- **Strategic Directness:** Documentation must bridge the gap between high-level vision and granular execution. 
- **Action-Oriented Technicality:** Use concise, imperative language for tasks and technical specifications to minimize cognitive load for AI Technicians.
- **Visionary Alignment:** Strategic documents (Analysis/PRDs) should reflect the long-term impact on the business ecosystem (R0-R3), utilizing metaphorical clarity where it aids strategic decision-making.

## Visual & Structural Identity
- **PARA Hierarchy:** All information must adhere to the PARA structure (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) to maintain a "Zero-G" organizational state.
- **Signal Clarity:** KPIs and status reports must be presented with high "Signal-to-Noise" ratios, utilizing standardized templates like `business_kpi.json`.
- **Atomic Operations:** Procedures should be broken down into atomic, verifiable steps to ensure reliability and auditability by the Manager.
