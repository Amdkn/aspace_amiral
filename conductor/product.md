# Initial Concept
Amiral's Operating System: A framework for business orchestration and KPI monitoring using AI agents.

# Product Definition: A'Space OS

## Target Users
- **The Amiral (Visionary/User Sovereign):** Responsible for strategic oversight, KPI tracking, and setting the business cap.
- **AI Technicians & Managers (Amadeus A0/Antigravity):** Responsible for automated execution, file management, and translating vision into procedures.
- **External Clients & Franchise Partners (R3):** The ultimate beneficiaries of the value-added services and standardized outputs of the OS.

## Business Goals
- **Scalable Sovereignty ("Built to Sell"):** Creating market value by standardizing AI-driven procedures that allow the business to operate independently of the founder.
- **Precision Governance (Pulse System):** Implementing a real-time dashboard for critical business KPIs to eliminate "blind" decision-making.
- **Infrastructure Expansion (R0-R3):** Orchestrating a seamless value chain from local machine control (R0) to global client franchises (R3).

## Core Features (MVP)
- **Automated PARA Management:** Maintaining organizational hygiene across Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives to prevent cognitive overload.
- **KPI Pulse Logger:** A robust system to capture and visualize business health signals within the `business_kpi.json` template.
- **Delegation Bridge:** A standardized protocol (e.g., Ralph Bridge) to facilitate the hand-off between high-level strategic planning and low-level technical execution.
