# A'Space OS - Amiral Requirements
# Python Standard Library Only (No external dependencies)
# Python >= 3.8

# Note: This project currently uses only Python standard library modules
# All dependencies are built-in to Python 3.8+:
# - json, os, sys, argparse, subprocess, unittest, datetime, time, urllib

# Platform-specific:
# - msvcrt (Windows only - for file locking in pulse_logger.py)
#   On Linux/macOS, this will need to be replaced with fcntl

# Future dependencies should be added here with version pins:
# example-package==1.0.0
