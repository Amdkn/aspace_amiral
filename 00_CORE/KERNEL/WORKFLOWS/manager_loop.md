1. **Phase: The Audit (Knowledge Retrieval)**
   - Check `00_CORE/KERNEL/KNOWLEDGE/INDEX.md` for relevant patterns.
   - Check `00_GOVERNANCE.md` to confirm OS priorities (S1 > S2 > S3).

2. **Phase: Strategic Planning (The Manager's Desk)**
   - Identify the current track in `conductor/tracks.md`.
   - Update or create the `plan.md` for the specific track.
   - Define the **Definition of Done (DoD)** for the current step.

3. **Phase: Task Delegation (Activating the Technician)**
   - Formulate clear, atomic instructions for **Amadeus (Technician)**.
   - Ensure Amadeus has the necessary `Skills` from the **Skills Factory**.

4. **Phase: Validation & Knowledge Update**
   - Verify the Technician's output (Signals, DB rows, File states).
   - If successful: Update `tracks.md` and move to next step.
   - If failed: Extract the **Lesson Learned**, update the Grimoire, and adjust the Plan.

5. **Phase: Reporting to the Visionary**
   - Provide a high-level summary of progress, focus on **Sovereignty** and **Anti-fragility**.
