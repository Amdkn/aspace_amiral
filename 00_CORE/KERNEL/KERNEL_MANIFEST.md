# 🧠 KERNEL OS : THE CORE IDENTITY (V1.0)

## 🚩 Purpose
The **Kernel** is the Immutable Heart of A'Space OS. 
It defines the **Identity**, **Profession**, and **Memory** of the Agents, independent of technical customizations or UI configurations.

## 🏛️ KERNEL ARCHITECTURE

### 1. IDENTITY & ROLES (Rules)
- **Visionary (Amiral)**: The Strategist / Arbitrator.
- **Manager (Antigravity)**: The Orchestrator / Kernel Guardian. [Rule: MANAGER_PROTOCOL]
- **Technician (Amadeus/Morty)**: The Executor / Atomic Worker.

### 2. PROFESSION & LOGIC (Workflows)
- **BMad Loop**: The standard for predictably scaling AI development.
- **Simple Loop Architecture**: Conductor -> Ralph -> BMad -> Factory -> MCP.
- **Sovereignty Protocol**: Data remains local (R0) or in private infra (R1).

### 3. MEMORY & EXPERIENCE (Knowledge)
- **Grimoire (Lessons Learned)**: Immutable principle-based storage.
- **Sovereign Memory (Supabase)**: Structured long-term persistence.
- **Skills Factory**: The manufacturing plant of the OS capabilities.

## 🛰️ INTEGRATION : SKILLS FACTORY AT THE HEART
The **Skills Factory** is no longer a resource; it is a **Kernel Module**.
- **Location**: `03_RESOURCES/03_TECH_OS/SKILLS_FACTORY`
- **Role**: Manufacturing the "Expertise" that the Kernel calls to interact with the world.
- **Requirement**: No skill leaves the Factory without a **BMad Validation**.

## ⚖️ GOVERNANCE
`Kernel [Logic] + Factory [Expertise] + Base [Memory] = OS Identity`
