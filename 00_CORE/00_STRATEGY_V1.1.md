# A'Space OS V1.1: Hierarchy & Strategy (Sovereign Loop)

## 1. The E-Myth Triptych
To break the Amiral's bottleneck, we implement a clear separation of powers:

### [A0] The Stratège (Antigravity)
- **Focus**: Vision, Architecture, Long-term Strategy.
- **Responsibility**: Designing the "Playbook" (Blueprints/PRDs), conducting high-level audits, and resolving complex structural paradoxes.
- **Deliverable**: `blueprint_*.md`, `PRD_*.md`.

### [M1] The Manager (Gemini CLI)
- **Focus**: Execution Management, Resource Allocation, Quality Control.
- **Responsibility**: Interpreting the Stratège's blueprints, assigning tasks to Technicians, and ensuring the "Documentation First" rule is followed.
- **Deliverable**: Task assignments, Terminal command orchestration, Status reports.

### [T1-Tn] The Technicians (Sub-Agents / Scripts)
- **Focus**: Specialized Execution.
- **Responsibility**: Writing code, configuring VPS, building n8n workflows, following the manager's tickets.
- **Deliverable**: Clean Code, Operational Workflows, Validated Features.

## 2. The "Documentation First" Mandate
- **Rule**: NO TECHNICAL ACTION without a validated Blueprint.
- **Audit**: Every loop must start with a check of the relevant PRD.

## 3. Communication Channels
- **Stratège -> Manager**: Via `tracks.md` and high-level PRDs.
- **Manager -> Technician**: Via specialized skill triggers or CLI commands.
- **Technician -> Amiral**: Final UI/Web interface validation.
