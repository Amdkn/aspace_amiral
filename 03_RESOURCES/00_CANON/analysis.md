# ANALYSIS: PARA Structure Integrity Verification

## Objective
Verify that the core PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) directory structure is present and correctly initialized according to the Amiral's Operating System (A'Space OS) standards.

## Findings
- **01_PROJECTS**: Exists. Contains active builds (e.g., `signal_pulse.py`).
- **02_AREAS**: Exists. Currently empty (awaiting continuous responsibilities).
- **03_RESOURCES**: Exists. Contains core grimoires, canon documents, and templates.
- **04_ARCHIVES**: Exists. Contains legacy data and historical context.

## Conclusion
The PARA structure is integral and ready for the next phase. Verification successful.
