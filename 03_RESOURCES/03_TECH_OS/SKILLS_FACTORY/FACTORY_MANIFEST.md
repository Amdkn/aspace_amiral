# 🏭 TECH-OS: SKILLS FACTORY (V1.0)

## 🚩 Purpose
The **Skills Factory** is the manufacturing plant of the A'Space OS. 
It follows the principle that **Loops (BMad) without Skills are aimless**, and **Skills without Loops are tools without a hand**.

The Factory is where we:
1. **Design**: Define the requirements for a new capability.
2. **Build**: Create the `SKILL.md`, scripts, and resources.
3. **Test**: Validate the skill in a controlled loop.
4. **Deploy**: Move the validated skill to `.gemini/skills/` for the Conductor/Ralph to use.

## 🛠️ Architecture
- `/00_PROTOTYPES`: Experimental skills in development.
- `/01_STAGING`: Skills ready for final testing.
- `/02_PRODUCTION`: Master copies of deployed skills.
- `/scripts`: Automation for building and deploying skills.

## 📜 Factory Protocols
- **Atomic Capabilities**: Every skill must solve ONE specific problem (e.g., `git_automation`, `n8n_audit`).
- **Standardized Documentation**: Every skill MUST have a `SKILL.md` following the official Gemini schema.
- **Safety First**: Skills affecting R0 or R1 must include explicit safety boundaries.

## 🏗️ The New Paradigm
`Loop [BMad] + Tool [MCP] + Expertise [Skills] = Sovereignty`
