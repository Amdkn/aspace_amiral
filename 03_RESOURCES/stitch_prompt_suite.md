# 🧶 Stitch AI Prompt Suite: A'Space OS

Use these high-fidelity prompts in the **Google Stitch** chat to generate the "Perfect" interfaces for our Digital Twin ecosystem.

## 1. The Solarpunk Light WebTop Shell
**Prompt:**
> Design a tech-maximalist desktop shell in **Light Mode**. The aesthetic is 'Solarpunk Luminous'. Background: A bright, creamy aura mesh gradient with soft emerald and amber glows. Interface: Ultra-rounded floating glass cards (rounded-full, 48px radius) with massive backdrop-blur. Include a high-density, white-frosted status bar. Dock icons should be vibrant and nature-inspired. Everything should feel organic, bright, and premium. Tailwind CSS.

## 2. Beth Core: Ikigai Alignment Center (Light)
**Prompt:**
> Create a high-fidelity 'Ikigai Alignment' dashboard in **Bright Solarpunk Light Mode**. Centerpiece: A large, radiant radial alignment meter (looking like a glowing geometric flower). Surround it with circular progress rings for 'Vitality', 'Clarity', and 'Connection' in emerald green and golden amber. Use white-glass panels with subtle drop-shadows. The sidebar should be highly dense but clean, using nature-tech motifs (vines, leaves, tech lines). Tone: 'Celestial Bio-Station'.

## 3. High-Density Telemetry (Luminous Variant)
**Prompt:**
> Design a multi-vessel telemetry window in **Luminous White Glass**. Contrast USS Orville (Nature-Green) vs USS Discovery (Sky-Blue) on a bright, translucent backdrop. Use elegant, high-contrast typography. Progress bars should look like glowing neon fluid in crystal tubes. Incorporate 40px rounded corners and a pure white aesthetic with vibrant data accents. High information density.

## 4. Pillar Alignment Veto System
**Prompt:**
> Create a specialized component for a 'Veto Alignment System'. Design a high-fidelity card that shows a numeric resonance score (e.g., 0.927) and a list of strategic veto conditions using HUD-style markings. Use a 'Solar/Amber' color palette for alerts. The design must feel like a tactical terminal from a sci-fi cockpit.
